# Mythic Metals

Mythic Metals is a Fabric based Minecraft mod, that adds over 30 new axes, swords, hoes, pickaxes, shovels, ores, ingots, and sets of armor. 
The mod is heavily inspired by Shadowclaimers Metallurgy, and was originally intended as a port. After being denied the privilege to do so this mod was created from the ground up as my first proper Minecraft mod.  

This is the update branch, and it will see changes over time.

## Patchnotes
Added common tags for ores, tools, and ingots  
Added storage blocks for all ingots  
Removed True Alloy  
Metallurgium now requires to be upgraded onto Netherite armor with a smithing table  

Currently there is one addon being worked on for this mod by the user DH (Fabricord), and a link will be added to the page once it is completed!
